## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please take the following steps:

1. **Do not open an issue on GitHub**. Instead, send an email to the project maintainers. This helps avoid public disclosure of the vulnerability until it has been addressed.
   
2. Provide the following details in your report:
   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - The potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - Any possible mitigation strategies you have in mind.

3. We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a plan for addressing the issue. We aim to resolve security vulnerabilities as soon as possible, typically within a week of the initial report.

4. Once the vulnerability has been patched, we will release a new version of the project and publicly disclose the vulnerability, crediting the individual who reported it (unless they wish to remain anonymous).

## General Security Recommendations

- **Environment Variables**: Ensure that sensitive data, such as API keys and client secrets, are stored securely in environment variables or secret management tools.
  
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints to prevent abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production to protect data in transit.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Ensure that endpoints requiring authentication are correctly protected and that sensitive operations (e.g., payment processing) are only accessible to authorized users.

- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies to their latest stable versions to avoid known security vulnerabilities.
