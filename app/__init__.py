Author's Note:
This script serves as the entry point of the FastAPI application. It initializes the app, sets up routes, and launches the server using Uvicorn. 

The goal is to provide a high-performance API for handling push payment requests and transaction status using Moniepoint's gateway.

Feel free to modify the routes or add additional middleware as needed to extend the functionality.
